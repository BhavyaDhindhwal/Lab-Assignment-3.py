Personal Portfolio Website

Description

This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my skills and projects as a Full Stack Developer. It demonstrates clean design, accessibility, and responsive layouts built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a seamless experience on all devices.

Viewing Responsive Behavior

To see the responsive behavior of the website:

•	Open the portfolio site in a web browser.

•	Resize the browser window to different widths to see the layout adjust dynamically.

•	Alternatively, use the browser’s developer tools to simulate various screen sizes and devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

•	The website’s content and navigation adapt smoothly to provide an optimal user experience across all these device types.
